# Smart-Parking-Lot-Management
Smart Parking Lot Management using linked lists. Tracks car entry/exit, allocates slots dynamically, and handles overflow when the lot is full. Demonstrates real-world use of data structures in traffic and parking systems.

Overview

The Smart Parking Lot Manager is a Python project that simulates a real-world parking system. It uses a linked list to store parked cars, with dynamic slot allocation. If the lot is full, new cars are rejected. This project demonstrates how data structures can be applied in traffic and parking management systems.

Features

 Park Car – Add a new car if slots are available.

 Exit Car – Remove a car when it leaves the lot.

 Display Lot – Show all currently parked cars with their slots.

 Overflow Handling – Prevents adding cars when lot is full.

 Dynamic Allocation – Cars occupy slots dynamically via linked list.
